Lands of Ariya

Cinnaptix Studios

	"Welcome to Ariya traveller. Our world is unlike any you have visited, I am sure. 
	As glorious as its outer apperance may seem, Ariya is a chaotic place full of wonders and horrors alike. For thousands of cycles men, elves, and all the other goodly
races have attepted to subdue her, yet all efforts have been in vain. Civilizations long extinct still haunt us, the weather is tempered like that of a spoiled child. 
The Gods play with their children as though they we mere toys, waging their wars at the cost of our souls. Be prepared traveller, for once you have begun to unlock her mysteries,
Ariya will have claimed you as one of her own."

--Lord Septimus, 365 NDE --
